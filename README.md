# p2-gc01-Ideadly-Skies
Repo to host the deployment for p2-gc01-ideadly-skies project, to create the CMS application as a follow up to the first project that we did a couple of weeks ago. Utilized firebase for authentication and firestore to store all of the user credentials when registering to access the crud features at the home page.
